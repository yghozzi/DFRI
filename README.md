Deep Fuzzy approach to Retrieval Image

Deep Fuzzy to Retrieval Image" refers to a method or technique used in the field of image retrieval that combines concepts from the field of deep learning with approaches based on fuzzy logic. This approach aims to improve the capacity of systems image search engine to understand and find relevant images using both deep learning models to extract complex features from images and fuzzy logic techniques to deal with uncertainty and variability in search queries.

More specifically, this approach may involve the use of deep neural networks to extract rich, abstract representations from images, thereby capturing important semantic and visual information. Then, fuzzy logic can be used to model the similarity between images by accounting for variability and ambiguity in the extracted features, as well as in users' search queries.

By combining these two approaches, "Deep Fuzzy to Retrieval Image" seeks to improve the accuracy and relevance of image search results, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods which may be less effective in dealing with the complexity and subjectivity inherent in image search tasks. This hybrid approach can be used in various contexts, such as online image searching, image database management, or image analysis in areas such as computer vision and intelligence. artificial.
